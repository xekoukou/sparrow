VERY IMPORTANT : When a set of inputs is cuttable, the "complement" is also cuttable since it will never be executed, thus it needs to be removed.

The complement of every \or or \partial is cuttable but not together with their complements, separately.

We need to take the complement and expand it if other inputs are part of the com that has elements of the complement.



IMPORTANT. In every \partial or \or the sender sends to both options. the one contains data, the other informs the recipient that this path was not chosen.
