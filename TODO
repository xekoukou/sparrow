The serializer needs to have two buffers for both input and output (4 total) that allow it to finish his work per object. He can add data from the second object to the first and second buffer. The buffer is bigger than all fixed sized objects it will serialize.
For variable-sized objects, one can split them into multiple fixed-sized ones or malloc a new buffer.

If the variable-sized object is smaller than our buffer size, we can put it into the previous buffers and no malloc is required.


A. Subgraph abstraction/polymorphism

or

B. When the original and last vector correspond to the identity vectors. then the subgraph abstraction can represent communication patterns like cryptographic protocols. It would be nice if we ommited the subgraph with a new type of arrow that corresponds to that specific subgraph abstraction.

*----------------------->*


Question:

Some subgraphs might contain a common state. For example, a tcp connection requires the initialization phace to start sending messages.

A tls protocol has the initial phase as well. It might have more state.

I think that subgraphs should not have state that is kept from previous interactions. Can we generalize the need to initialize some state for a subgraph.

The problem is that two subgraphs depend on one another and is not specified in the graph. That creates dependencies that are not visible and it will create problems.
||
||
||
^^ not necessarily. We do that anyway when we keep the state in any other program. The graph only represents the external interactions, not the internal state that is required for the application to work.

====> We need to provide a rule of seperation of state between different parts of the graph. For subgraphs to be replacable, we require that the their state is independent of each other.

If a subgraph depends on another's state, we need to specify it. We introduce a dependency arrow that guarantees that a specific subgraph requires another subgraph. And their order.


IMPORTANT

Definition : A subgraph that interacts with the higher graph through identity arrows is called a 


Initializations that only happen once should be abstracted away.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

We call an identity arrow a data dependency between the same node. Since the input and output node are the same , the communication does not happen.

A subgraph does not interact with the state of its parent unless specified by an identity arrow.

Explanation: We need to explicitly specify the state dependencies between subgraphs so as to permit their combosability/modularity.  ??
It might not be necessary.
||
||
||
^ It is up to the application to seperate the state between the different subgraphs.



---------------------------------------------------------

A sequenced is a subgraph that has only one concurrent path and thus it does not require a label on its different concurrent paths to distinguish the messages it receives.

We call a subgraph agnostic if it doesn't need to know the paths of the other subgraphs that are higher than it.

We call a subgraph instant if the execution of the graph happens without continuations.


Theorem. : A subgraph that is instant is agnostic.

Theorem B : A subgraph that is only executed when the concurrent higher paths are only one is agnostic.

Theorem : A subgraph that is not instant and there are multiple concurrent higher paths that use it cannot be agnostic.

Theorem B does not permit combosability between specific subgraphs, thus it should be rejected.

Theorem : An instant subgraph can only contain subgraphs that are instant.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Persistence

A protocol execution is called agent-consistent if the agent that interacts for a specific type of agent in the protocol is unique and takes part in all the interactions that affect him.

1. A protocol is called multi party when multiple agents interact with each other.

2. A tcp connection "guarantees" that the agents that interact are the same during a multi-party protocol. Thus it guarantees agent-consistency.

A protocol execution is concurrent when multiple concurrent instances of it are processed at the same time.

3. A tcp connection is rare resource.

4. There exist protocols that can span long periods of time or cannot guarantee s specific time duration. We call those protocols time-costly and time-unreliable.

Theorem A time-costly and time-unreliable protocols require a high number of connections to guarantee agent-consistency for concurrent protocol execution, thus are impossible since tcp connections are rare.

Most sessions need to have a specific  session id so as to be persisted across a multiparty protocol.

Other more common protocols do not require persistence.

-------

Global unique id.

Agent-consistency can be easily provided if we are able to produce a global unique id. The easiest way to produce such an id is if we allow a single
peer to produce it and sign it.

1. There are some problems though. That peer can potentially malevolently break agent consistency with other session that he signed himself.

2. Using a (decentralized(zookeeper) or not) trusted authority to provide the unique id creates centralization points (if we have many trusted authorities, then we have a partially decentralized scheme).


-------

Local unique id.

Agent-consistency can be achieved with the creation of a local unique id.


If we have multiplte concurrent paths, the local unique id solution encounters the same problem as the global unique id produced from a single peer.

Consider this example.

a----->d-------e------>c
a----->b------>c=======c

The only common between e and c is the local unique id that is produced by a and sent to d and b.

------------------

Persistence

A. We call a protocol agent-static if all the agents that are to take part in it are known in advance.

Theorem A A non concurrent protocol can guarantee agent-consistency with the creation of local unique ids.

proof: The unique id is created by an agent, then propagated by the other agents and sent to the same agent to continue the protocol. 
None of the other agents is able to defraud the local id. The only thing that could happen is the failure of the protocol.

Theorem B An agent-static protocol can guarantee agent-consistency with an initialization phase that produces a unique id.

Theorem C


--------

Non-concurrent protocol:

Using sha2 or any data structure whose values are sparse in a DOMAIN, we can guarantee that one does not find a specific value that is used by another session.
Thus allowing only the hijuck of session ids that are already known to an agent.

example. If agent A has two sessions with agent B, he could replace the id of session 1 with the id of the other and agent B wouldn't be able to notice.

--------------------------------
--------------------------------

Persistence


We use a session cookie that is signed by all participants in a dynamic fashion as soon as they are picked. Each participant then creates private cookie ids with the participants he is to talk to.

64 concurrent paths (1 byte encoding).

The conditional problem


In order to set timeouts so as to express failure, we need to be able to expect a specific action.

If our protocol has conditional protocol paths, then the absense of a specific packet ariving at a specific path does not consitute a failure if a packet arrived at a different conditional path. We thus need to set a global timeout on the conditional itself.

Or we can hide the conditional.

For two agents protocols , conditionals do not pose a problem because we can hide the conditional, we can have a global timeout because we are certain that a packet should arrive at the second agent after a period of time.


n-agent protocols with n > 2 have the above problem.  CHECK the below solution.


To find all timeouts that have expired we need a trie.

-------------------------------------------------------------------


Failure and timeouts.

A failure can only happen at a specific edge. It can be detected by the transmitter node or the receiver node. Timeouts are used to detect those failures.

a ----> b ( b cannot know if a knows of the failure, so b needs to tell a of the failure. Then b waits for a response a second time. If that fails too, b can handle the problem without coordination with a.) Thus all timeouts are only required to be handled at the receiving end.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The conditional solution. The receiving branch needs to verify to the transmitter that it got the msg.

a ------> b -> a -> b ----> c ----> d ----> e
          |         |
          -----------

conditionals do not have timeouts.


FAILURES are globally known, thus parts of our protocol might run concurrently and inconsistently.

Introducing a single node that takes inputs from both parts of the protocol is a good way to verify the protocol till a specific point.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output timeouts and errors in general -- reconnects and a secondary layer that only gives a send and receive api.

Important 

Msg delimination is equivallent to keeping state of the data received. Assuming that all data sent to a higher level are always complete, then we do not need msg delimination all the time, only if there is no previous protocol that guarantees the completeness of the msg.

examples: 1) TLS minght guarantee that all msgs sent will be sent to the application complete.
          2) The TCP layer does not guarantee this, so a msg delimination is required between our protocol and the TCP layer so as to hide the bad bahahior of the TCP layer.
          

---------------------------------------------

Reconnecting the socket should be handled by the session manager. This is necessary because it also needs to handle the saving of the state to hard disk anyway.

--------------------------------------------------

Higher levels need to keep the list of sockets that are active, so as to only connect to the ones that are not active.


------------------------------------------------------------

TODO After retry issue a sesssion initialization event.


---------------------------------------------

same datatype sent between the same agents should have a tag so as to differentiate them. This is important because each agents has a different knowledge of the global state and these knowledges do not need to be consistent with each other.
